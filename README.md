# Capstone
This repository contains a data analysis project that aims to establish a relationship between sexual harassment towards women and social classes across Spain, the United States (USA), and Argentina. The project is structured with several Jupyter notebooks, each containing data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis for different countries and years.

## Objectives
This project aims to solve two main questions:
  1. What are the key factors that contribute to the differences in social class prevalence across these countries?
  
  2. How does the prevalence of sexual harassment vary across different social classes in Spain, USA, and Argentina?

To answer these, several data sources for each different country have been used and data for each country has been manipulated to establish the social classes.


## Notebooks

  路 'ARGENTINA.ipynb' contains data cleaning, preprocessing, and k-means clustering to establish social classes for Argentina for 2015, 2017 and 2020.
  
  
  路 'SPAIN.ipynb' contains data cleaning, preprocessing, and k-means clustering to establish social classes for Spain for 2015, 2017 and 2020.
  
  
  路 'USA.ipynb' contains data cleaning, preprocessing, and k-means clustering to establish social classes for USA for 2015, 2017 and 2020.
  
  
  路 'Correlation.ipynb' This notebook contains the number of sexual harassment cases for each country and year, and performs a correlation analysis between the number of people in each social class for every year and every country and the number of sexual harassment cases.
