# Capstone
This repository contains the code, data, and analysis for a comparative study on the relationship between social class and sexual harassment across the United States, Argentina, and Spain from 2015 to 2020. The study aims to explore the correlation between social classes and sexual harassment, examine the differences in social class distribution across countries, and investigate the impact of various factors on sexual harassment trends.

## Objectives
This project aims to solve three main questions:
  1. What are the key factors that contribute to the differences in social class prevalence across these countries?
  
  2. 	Which factors hold more significance in shaping social class clusters?
  
  3. How does the prevalence of sexual harassment vary across different social classes in the USA, Argentina, and Spain?


To answer these, several data sources for each different country have been used and data for each country has been manipulated to establish the social classes.

 ##  Data
The data/ directory contains the raw data for each country, separated into individual subdirectories. The data for this study was obtained from various sources, such as government databases, international organizations, and academic research. Please refer to the thesis for a detailed description of the data sources and methodology.
  
## Dependencies

## Suggestions for Future Work
Expand the study to include additional countries and regions to further understand the relationship between social class and sexual harassment.

Develop and administer standardized surveys with comparable questions across countries to ensure more reliable data for comparison.

Investigate the impact of various factors, such as the #MeToo movement, new laws targeting sexual harassment, and the COVID-19 pandemic, on sexual harassment trends.
